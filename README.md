# iris-recognition
Iris recognition technology has been make practical and effective use for the security of mobile phones. Iris recognition provides high level of security for cellular phone based services for example purchasing of goods from shopping site, internet banking transaction service via mobile phone. The implementation of iris biometric on mobile phone is totally dependent on the iris image quality. The high quality of iris images was achieved through special hardware design and using built-in mega-pixel camera. Considering the relatively small CPU processing power of cellular phone a new pupil and iris localization algorithm for cellular phone platform was proposed based on detecting dark pupil and corneal secular reflection by changing brightness &amp; contrast value.
